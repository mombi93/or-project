    Linear programming is a method to find the optimal solution to combinatorial optimisation problems. One of those
    problems, is the vehicle routing problem (VRP). VRP has been studied decades due to its difficulty in finding the optimal solution
     and wide range og applications in the real world.
    In this project, we will be using linear programming to solve a specific instance of a VRP, based on a problem given by
    a furniture company. In addition, we will also analyse the performance of three different LP tools: Gurobi, or-tools and
    Optaplanner. Our goal is to be able to find an optimal solution to the problem and analyse the strengths and weaknesses
    of the chosen tools. First, we create LP formulations: the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and the capacitated
     vehicle routing problem with time windows (CVRPTW), based on the given problem. Then, we carry out performance
    analysis on the LP tools on the benchmark and test datasets. Finally, we choose a tool based
    on the performance analysis and find the optimal solution to the given problem. Our analysis conclude that Optaplanner is the
    ideal tool for this problem, even though Gurobi has the better performance overall. The solution for the given VRP instance
    using Optaplanner uses 8 vehicles and yield eucledian distances of 10.27 and 10.49 for CVRP and CVRPTW model respectively.
