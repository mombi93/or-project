\chapter{Results and Discussions}
\section{Results}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test run on test data set
\item The optimal solution in terms of scaled and metric distance (from Optaplanner)
\item The routes that for each of the vehicle
\item Number of vehicle used (/< 16)
\item Make recommendations for the company (how many vehicles to use, which route etc...)
\item Compare and contrast different tools used to get the results of the CVRP 60 node analyses. Compare time taken and obj value.
\item Route Visualisation (taken from Optaplanner)
\item Any failed attempt at modelling the problem (GLPK, and part of the or-tools etc)..
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How accurate is the model compared to the real life scenario?
\item How accurate is the solution from the global optimum? (if possible)
\item Discuss the obj value obtained from the comparison and discuss how the formulation may affect the results.
\item Advantages and Disadvantages of using each tool and suggest which tool to use given user profile.
\item Anything that went wrong
\end{enumerate}
