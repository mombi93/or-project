        Test & T-VRP-9 & 9 & 3 & 4 & This is benchmark dataset that is used if the LP models are implemented correctly. The model of this dataset
        has a known best solution\\ \hline
        Test & T-VRP-60 & 60 & 5 & 15 & This dataset uses the first 60 node of the P-VRP-227 dataset. It is used for to model a CVRP instance that is
        similar to the given problem.
