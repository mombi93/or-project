\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have successfully conducted an OR study using the methodology stipulated in chapter 1 based on the problem defined chapter 3.
We have successfully created LP formulations out of modelled those them using
 the chosen LP tools. Our analysis shows that Gurobi has the best overall performance and whereas or-tools has the worst.
 Our analysis concludes that Optaplanner performs better in solving the given VRP problem. We have used optaplanner to find
 the optimal solution to the problem and it yields 10.27 and 10.49 eucledian distances for CVRP and CVRPTW model
 respectively. The real distances in km are 798.23 and 828.23 for CVRP and CVRPTW model respectively.  This analysis
 has one downside which is that it does not accurately model road distances, which may reduce the accuracy by as much
 as x percent.

There are clearly more room for improvements in some aspects of this project, which would be ideal for future work.
One would be to incorporate road distances to ensure that the model simulate real life scenario as accurately as
possible. We could also replicate the same study under different environment and limitations, such as using high performance
computer or using a longer time limit. Instead of focusing on solely solving VRP, we can test the performance of the solver
on other benchmark datasets.
