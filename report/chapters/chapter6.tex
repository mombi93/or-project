\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
In here I shall conclude a few things: we've started off with a primer on linear programming and discussed its state
 of the art. Obtained the optimal routes that yields the minimum distance and the number of vehicles to use. Made
 recommendations based on those findings to the company. Also compare and contrast the tools used for optimisation. Also
 included anything that went wrong during the project\footnote{footnote 1}

\textbf{Future Work}
More accurate model with road distance and taking into account traffic conditions like traffic jam etc. Model
 different variants of the problem, such as Multi depot cvrp etc. Dive into the source  code / manual of
 the tools to further understand how it works and use them to get better results.\footnote{footnote 2}

 Experiment with different solvers

 Work out on their optimality...
